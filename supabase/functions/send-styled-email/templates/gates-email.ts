        <h2 style="color: #9b87f5; font-size: 24px; margin: 24px 0;">Bill Gates and the Number 28: The Key to His Wealth</h2>
        <p style="color: #E5E7EB; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          One of the most fascinating aspects of Bill Gates' numerology is the number 28, which plays a critical role in his life path and his wealth. Gates was born on October 28, 1955. In numerology, 28 is the number of wealth, success, and power. The number is connected to individuals who are destined for financial prosperity and significant accomplishments.

        <h2 style="color: #9b87f5; font-size: 24px; margin: 24px 0;">Why Did Microsoft Skip Windows 9?</h2>
        <p style="color: #E5E7EB; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          What's fascinating is that Bill Gates made a similar move years earlier, demonstrating that both men shared a deep understanding of numerology and used it in their decision-making processes. In fact Microsoft skipped over Windows 9. Instead of calling it Windows 9, Gates went straight from Windows 8 to Windows 10.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #E5E7EB; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          This move was even before Jobs' move with Apple, as both tech moguls seemed to understand that 9 represented completion, and they wanted to avoid that finality energy in their product launches.

        <h2 style="color: #9b87f5; font-size: 24px; margin: 24px 0;">The Power of 28 in the World of Wealth</h2>
        <p style="color: #E5E7EB; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          Some of the wealthiest figures of our time were born on the 28th of the month. Take Elon Musk, born on June 28, 1971, who is currently the richest person in the world, with a net worth frequently surpassing $416 billion. His immense wealth and groundbreaking companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, align perfectly with the numerological energy of the number 28.
        </p>
        <h2 style="color: #9b87f5; font-size: 24px; margin: 24px 0;">More Wealthy Entities Linked to the Number 28</h2>
        <p style="color: #E5E7EB; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          It's not just individuals who benefit from the numerology of 28. Major global corporations and organizations also use this powerful number. Take Vanguard, the world's largest asset management firm, managing more than $10 trillion in assets. Vanguard was incorporated in a 28 day, a deliberate alignment with the energy of wealth.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #E5E7EB; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          Similarly, Apple, the world's most valuable company with an estimated worth of $3.5 trillion, was also incorporated in a 28 day. Apple's dominance in the tech industry and its financial power is a direct testament to the success and influence of the number 28.
