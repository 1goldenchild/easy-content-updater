            9 is one of the most misunderstood numbers out here; it's an extremely important number in the matrix. 9 is the number of completion and ending, but not only that, when something comes to a 9, either it ends right there, or it gets transcended to the next level into a better version.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            9 is the number of reality and illusion. Reality starts with "R," which is the 18th letter, and illusion starts with "I," which is the 9th letter. Because reality is not really the realm we live in. Everything is an illusion; nothing is really there. That table you see is not actually hard; the energy is just moving extremely slow to a point where you think it's solid, but solid matter is not actually real.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            When I said number 9 is the number manifestation, not necessarily that 9s are the richest because they are not, although they could be. 9 thrives in society when it's based on spirituality. If it's not based on spirituality, they have a hard time finding their purpose. Every single thing around you is a 9. Don't believe me? If it's physical, it has a shape by definition.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Just look at all the shapes. Let's say a circle, it has 360 degrees. 3+6=9. Or a square; 1 angle has 90 degrees, 2 angles is 180, which is 9, 3 has 270, which is 9, all four angles have 360 degrees, which is 9. You're starting to understand?
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            On another note, 9s are extremely spiritual and usually rebellious; they don't fit well in the box; they like to live outside the box. They are also one of the smartest numbers, but a lot of them are complete failures. 9 used to be widely respected in multiple ancient civilizations; in other numerology systems, they don't even include the 9 because they have too much respect for it.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            But the more this new world evolves with all technologies and especially the elite controlling us and blocking our spiritual ability, 9s have become kind of obsolete. That's why a lot of them are addicted to drugs. If you want a good example, just look at the "Wolf of Wall Street"; everyone likes this movie, right? Well, it was based on Jordan Belfort, who is born on the 9th; he was doing drug cocktails and mixing them for different periods of the day.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            So taking substances is one thing that all 9s should be very careful with because they have an addicted personality as it's hard for them to live in this era. But there are some evolved 9s. You're reading this, so you're probably an evolved 9 yourself; I'm an evolved 9. 9 also has the biggest ego. If you look at gematria, ego equals 9, and an ego is a superpower as long as you work hard to enjoy it.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            A reason 9s fall into drugs is because they think they are the best but don't actually do the job to justify it. So they can't cope with it and get addicted to substances. When talking about the ego, it's normal that 9s have the biggest ego. 9 is all around you; everything always comes back to the 9; 9x2 is 18, 1+8 is 9, and you can do so with any numbers.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            That's also why they are very adaptable; they can adapt to every situation. That is one of your gifts; you're extremely smart. The illusion and reality are dictated by the 9; without 9, reality is not full; it dictates what ends and what revolves to the next level. 9s are one of the smartest; one of the most spiritually advanced.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Now I'm gonna drop some big secrets right now, and don't forget where you heard it from. Numerology 33‚Ä¶ 9 is connected to the eye. üëÅÔ∏è The letter "I" is the 9th letter; pronounce "eye" and "I," same thing right? The frequency you use when saying it is the exact same, even in Arabic, the 18th letter when you say it is the same.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            A lot of 9s with karmic debt have eye problems; the elite gotta tell you everything; they told us in the movie "Jack Sparrow" with Johnny Depp. He's born in the 9th; he wore a patch on his eye, and in real life, he's actually close to being blind in one eye and has another problem in his other eye.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            What I think is one of the reasons 9s are so spiritually advanced is that because the 9 is connected with the eye and often have eye problems, the other senses get stronger. 9 is also strongly linked to the number 2, which is the feminine, extremely intuitive. Just look at the word "femi(nine)"; you can't say it without the 9 in there.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            9s are also energy suckers; they suck energy out of the numbers like a black hole. If you draw a 9 starting from the bottom and continue the motion, you will actually make a continuous spiral. Look at the pie; the pattern of the pie, which first vowel is 1, the 9th letter. Now, I'm saying too much, ahah...
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            On another note, I got another secret for you and the 9. There was a city called Nineveh built by non-elites who were close to overpowering the elite, but they lost and were destroyed; you should really look into that.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            One thing for sure is that if there is ever utopia on earth, 9 will be one of the major reasons behind it. 9 is also the most useful energy if you want to open your third eye. When I said that 9s are energy suckers, that is why usually 9s are the enemies of the master numbers because they have a lot of energy and it gets sucked right in.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            So to end about the 9, the friendly numbers of the number 9 are the 1-9, and the enemies are the 11-22 and the 33.
