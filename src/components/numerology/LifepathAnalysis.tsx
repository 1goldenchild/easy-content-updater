      33: `The Lifepath master number 33 is at the pinnacle of the number sequence. They are the master teachers, possessing the highest frequency among all numbers. It's a real powerhouse, also representing transcendence. Those with a 33 Lifepath have the most influence in societies; they are the trailblazers, always coming up with revolutionary ideas that help the masses progress. But one must understand that with great power also comes great responsibility. Being a 33 Lifepath is not easy. They possess an incredible intellect matching that of the 7s, with the capability to go even further. They don't just have intelligence but also the skills and influence to bring their ideas to the world. Anything they do has the power to reach global scales, and that should be their aim.

In Freemasonry, it goes up to the 33rd degree. Water freezes at 33 degrees, transcending states, as I mentioned earlier about transcendence. We have 33 vertebrae in our spine. When we activate each of the chakras, which are our energy centers, a sacred liquid rises up the 33 vertebrae and activates the pineal gland, giving psychic ability. Needless to say, 33 is a very spiritual number. Jesus died at 33, and he's the most influential human of all time. In the Quran, it's mentioned that in heaven, we will all be 33 years old because it's the number of all numbers. It's related to 3, 6, and 9, but we won't delve into that now. If you look at the speed an object needs to leave different levels such as the atmosphere or stratosphere, it needs to be directly connected to 33, again referring to transcendence.

As a 33, you need to be very careful about who you hang around with because, yes, you're an energy powerhouse, but that also means other numbers can lower your frequency, especially the number 9. Be cautious around the number 9, and if you encounter someone with a missing eye or eye problem, stay far away. I won't delve into why, but just be cautious. You are actually the rarest number because you can only be a Lifepath 33; you can't be born on the 33rd of the month. You're an extremely old soul. If you believe in religion, I mentioned the 33 in heaven or Jesus at 33, but if you believe in reincarnation, becoming a Lifepath 33 requires traversing many lifetimes. You can always fall back if you're not careful, and it's a long way down, so be cautious about aligning with your gift and using it for the right purpose.

Lifepath 33 individuals don't have a particular thing they are good at; they can excel in anything but it needs to influence people, and if it can be done on a global scale, even better. As a 33, you should meditate the most out of all the numbers. If you start any project, 33 has two 3s, which is the number of communication, so any field where communication is vital will be great for you. Most inventions used today were invented by Lifepath 33 individuals. Lifepath 33 individuals are usually right hemisphere dominant, which means creativity, spontaneity, and expression. They can lack discipline, but that's the downside of creativity and something to work on. You can't schedule when the next revolutionary idea will come, so if you can work in a field where your schedule can be flexible, it's great for you.

Also, you should wear some orange color or incorporate orange designs into your home. Try setting your time at 6:33 instead of 6:30, for example. If you want to change any bad habits, repeat it to yourself 33 times before going to sleep for 33 days straight, and you should be good. Lifepath 33 goes well with all the master numbers, and it also goes well with the numbers 6 and 7. However, be very careful with the number 9. On a 9 day, avoid arguments as it will drain your energy more than on other days. Open all your windows after a 9 day and burn some incense. You also do well with the number 5 as you both have the same free spirit and love for freedom. As a 33, you can't just work in a cubicle all day; it will lead to burnout and depression in the long run. Why have a Lamborghini if you're going to drive it like it's a Toyota? Number 6 is friendly to you; they are friendly and would love to help you on your journey. With a 6, you know they will not plot against you or stab you in the back, bringing peace of mind. Number 6 is all about home and family, and so is 33. Lifepath 33 believes deeply in the concept of a strong family.

The 33 and the 7 are the most intelligent numbers, but the 7 struggles to communicate and bring ideas down to the masses in a way they understand. You should work on communication because you have the gift to become elite at it, I'm talking about 0.1% elite.`,
      22: `The master number 22 is the number of the master builder. They are the second rarest number after the number 33, and they have an elevated master number frequency. These people, just like the 33, can bring any project or goal to a global scale. They are the master builders, from people to themselves to projects to companies. If you have a 22 on board, you already know you're in a good position. They are the best coaches; they have an assertive nature, but you never mistake it with the ruthlessness of the number 1. You can feel their compassion, especially in any kind of teaching or coaching, and it allows people to be pushed to their limits as they understand it comes from a place of love. They are connected to the number 4. Just like the number 4 is the hardest worker and to be able to be a hard worker, you must have a strong body, the 4 and 22 generally have tougher bodies with a natural increase in muscle mass, a little less for women, of course. If you look at the top bodybuilders, they are often 22 energy or born on the 22nd. Bradley Martin, who is the biggest fitness/bodybuilder on the internet, is also born on the 22nd. Overall, the number 22 is a friendly number that doesn’t make many enemies, but they should also stay far away from people under 9 energy and should be careful not to get into emotionally draining situations such as arguments or travel under 9 energy. Number 7s have a lot of enemies, but they usually tend to do better with 22s and 33s. Also, the 22s are only compatible with the number 3 66% of the time, so you need to keep that in mind when meeting any person with 3 energy as 1 in 3 will be a bad mix. When we are talking about bodybuilding, it’s not just about lifting weights. If you look at Bryan Johnson, who is the guy spending 3 million a year to stay young, he’s a 22 just to put it in perspective. 22s do well in any field where they can build and see progress. If they don’t see progress in whatever they are doing, they will turn to burnouts and depression, so the regular 9-5 life usually is not for them. You gotta take the risk and take that initiative. The number 22 is also the second hardest worker right after the 4. Hard work should be fun to you, and if it’s not, then you need to change what you are doing as soon as possible. You should also try to hang around master numbers as they are around the same elevated frequency as you.`,
      11: `As a Lifepath 11, firstly, the Lifepath 11 is a master number. The master number doesn't operate on the same frequency as others. You have a elevated frequency, which means your base level is higher than others'. If someone is the base level model, you are the upgraded version. You have more bandwidth, which also means that when you interact with people, because you're such a powerhouse, it actually lowers your frequency... just some food for thought. That’s why you should really care about who you keep around you. Also, the master number 11 is the number of charisma. Most presidents, radio stars, TV stars, podcasters, and streamers are actually Lifepath 11s because of their charisma. One reason is, as a Lifepath 11, you have a connection to both the 1 and the 2, which are masculine and feminine. You have the masculine drive with the feminine emotion, making it easy for you to connect with people on an emotional level. Again, that’s why 11s do so well in politics; they have masculine qualities with feminine touches, making it easier to connect with people. Also, in the 11, you have twice the number 1. 1 is all about aggression, masculine qualities, hard-headedness, focus... but mixed with a feminine touch. They are also great athletes. If you look at Michael Jordan, the greatest of all time in basketball, his biggest competition was Kobe Bryant. If you know a little bit about the sport of basketball, you know exactly what I’m talking about; these two are both 11s. If you want to bring your 11 energy to the highest level, you need to be in a field where you can use that mouthpiece, whether it be in sales or social media. You would actually shoot yourself in the foot if you're not in a field where you are compensated based on your social skills. Even if you're shy, you need to let the seed grow out of the soil. Don't be scared to take that risk… That's what keeps most 11s from obtaining their dreams. If you can't do it, nobody can... As an 11, you should always be proactive, always be in motion, never stand still. If you live the 9-5 cubicle life, it will slowly burn you from the inside, and you can get into depression, burnouts, and things like that. Always be in motion. But you should not be too worried about that because the 11s are some of the hardest workers, along with the numbers 4 and 22. Now let’s talk about how to use this to your advantage in social dynamics. If you're looking to get into entrepreneurial endeavors, you will encounter a lot of 8s because they are the numbers of money and power. The thing is, you have a love-hate relationship with 8s. You respect who they are, but they can be somewhat dictatorial, so that's one thing to keep in mind. Also, they don’t like to have their authority questioned. The problem is, just because of the charisma and the elevated frequency, they will feel threatened by you. Your soulmate number is the number 5. Numbers 5 and 11 go well together. 5 is about freedom, entertainment, being on the move, good looks; they fit well with 11s, but they will not be like, let’s say, a number 6, which would be more about the regular white picket fence house. Also, you might encounter some Lifepath 7s who would want to be with you. Lifepath 7s crave Lifepath 11s, but you need to be very, very careful because 7 is the number of the loner, high intelligence, and deep thinking, but it also has a lot of problems that come with it. So any romantic relationship with a 7 is not really recommended (not saying not to marry the love of your life if the person is a 7). Another thing is you should not hang around Lifepath 9s; they will totally drain you of your energy like you have never experienced. A little secret: if you see someone with a missing eye or an eye problem, try to stay away from that person; chances are that they have some 8 energy in them. As a Lifepath 11, you have a higher range of emotional receptors; you can feel things on a deeper level. 11s love to get in the fire, but often you should withdraw yourself from the situation and go far away from the city, reset your mind, fast for a day or two, regenerate your body cells, and come back fresh as new. Everything is a duality; yes, you have higher potential, but when you fall on the other side of the emotion scale, you can go deeper into the darkness. For an 11 to truly master the number, you should not run from your darkness; you should embrace it and keep it close to you, just like the saying "keep your friends close and your enemies closer." Do the same but for the darkness within you. Use it as motivation! Overall, you're a great leader; you can lead from the front or the back. Most people will actually envy your energy, and I would say it’s the Lifepath number that people would want the most. You're an old soul, and wisdom should be easily welcomed into your life. Don’t get stuck in emotional traps; fly high like an eagle. 🦅`,
      1: `So the Lifepath 1 is active, masculine, the opposite of Lifepath 2, which is passive, feminine. It embodies male energy, making its individuals the most aggressive of all numbers, not necessarily in a negative way, but you have to channel that energy correctly because with such ruthlessness, if it’s not directed properly, it can lead to unfavorable outcomes. Kind of like a Lamborghini being driven by an old grandma; the car wants to be driven as it was built to be. However, today we live in a society where masculinity is often deemed toxic, and there’s an attempt to confine it within a box. That’s one thing to keep in mind; the saying that goes, "it’s better to be a warrior in a garden than a gardener in a war" applies directly to you. People with 1 energy are aggressive; they thrive on competition, using it to fuel themselves. You have a significant fire inside you that seeks direction. People with 1 energy are naturally more muscular, like those with 4 energy and the master number 22. They possess great athletic ability, and everyone with Lifepath 1 should work out. If you don’t exercise, you should lead a very active work life; if you don’t project that fire into the world, it will consume you from within. It's up to you to choose whether to utilize or lose that energy; you must cultivate that power, or it will drain you, potentially leading to burnout and depression. These individuals have a one-track mind, extremely focused on their goals, and anyone getting in their way risks being crushed. On the intelligence scale, they fall in the mid-range, which is advantageous because they don’t tend to overthink, diving right into action to claim their share of success. They relish in fights, arguments, and debates. People like 4s and 8s dislike arguments as they dislike having their authority questioned, especially in jobs where they have authority over those with 4 and 8 energies. I know it can be challenging, but you must control it sometimes. People under the number 1 are also great leaders, although they can sometimes come off as abrasive. This isn't out of malice but because they are straightforward. Earlier, I mentioned how every aspect of masculinity is often labeled as toxic, especially in the new feminist era. This shift occurred around the year 2000 as we transitioned from the 1900s to the 2000s, with a global impact that's evident in today's society. The world has become softer; things that weren't tolerated in the 1900s, such as allowing men to play in women’s sports, are now accepted. Lifepath 1 individuals are also adept at making money because they can produce a huge amount of output due to their high energy levels. The wealth number is 28, which reduces to 1. The two richest individuals, Elon Musk and Bill Gates, have that 1 energy. If your goal is to make a lot of money, focus that output in the right fields and within a certain timeframe; you should start to see a massive difference in your life. Lifepath 1 individuals excel in fields where they are paid based on performance, whether it's entrepreneurial projects, sales/closing, or any type of coaching where they can channel their energy into others. They naturally lead by example from the front, unlike number 9, which leads from the back. Number 1 is the core of the 28, which runs the world. It's the number of beginnings; while 9 represents completion, 1 symbolizes beginnings. You have the ability to start a project and, through sheer force, make it successful. Overthinking isn't in your nature; dive into action as much as possible and don’t dwell on risk assessment. Lifepath 1 individuals are like planes; the only thing stopping them from crashing is their speed. You must always keep going, never stopping. Women born under the 1 energy are also great leaders; one example is Sheryl Sandberg, the COO of Facebook. Your soulmate number is 9. While 9 leads from the back and 1 leads from the front, both roles are important, and you understand each other without stepping on each other's toes. There's a love-hate relationship with number 8; while there’s respect, there's also friction because 8 loves authority and dislikes being questioned by someone with 1 energy. Your friendly number is 3; you tend to have a great relationship with this number. Confidence is abundant in both numbers, matching well. In love, Lifepath 1 individuals work well with those born on the 2nd, 20th, and most importantly, the 9th. Steve Jobs not only incorporated on the 28th but also married a Lifepath 9 before becoming a billionaire. If you closely examine his brand, each product starts with the letter "i" (iPhone, iMac, iPod), matching the compatible energy. Your enemy numbers are 4, 6, and 11. While 11 shares 1 energy, it often leads to confrontations, which you must be mindful of. Be cautious on days 1 in numerology, such as the 1st, 10th, 19th, and 28th, as they lead to compound Lifepath 1 days, making everyone more aggressive and amplifying your tendencies. Understand that on those days, you'll be more aggressive, and you must learn to control it. Lifepath 1 individuals often make many enemies in life, but it’s part of who you are, and you shouldn't apologize for it. Life needs someone like you to speak the truth with no filter because, after all, isn’t the truth important? Also, while 1 has a degree of spirituality, it’s not the most spiritual. However, considering we’re both here, I suppose you might be inclined toward spirituality. The number 19, which reduces to 9, represents "as above, so below," a very spiritual concept, allowing you to connect the dots. The best way for a Lifepath 1 to stay in tune with spirituality is to stay on track with their purpose, whatever it may be.`,
      3: `So you're a Life Path 3. 3 is the number of the child, 1 is the masculine number, 2 is the feminine number, and 3 is the childish number. When we say 'oh, you're childish,' it's usually an insult, but in this case, it is not. People with 3 energy maintain that childish mindset. They don’t get old and boring; they are the ones who, even at 85 years old, always love to play games and tell a good joke. They love to live life, and they are actually the ones who love themselves the most. 3 is the number of creativity. The right brain hemisphere is usually more dominant with people under that 3 energy, especially if it’s your Life Path number. They are extremely creative, but creativity comes with a downside, which is a lack of discipline. It can be balanced by your second number, but that's one thing to keep in mind and work on as it's your weakness. But it's also a strength because you can't schedule when a good idea will come to you. Number 3s don't tend to do very well with schedules, so if you can work for yourself, you would really benefit from that. 3 is the number of communication. If you look at the first letter, which is 'c', it's the third letter. Same thing with 'comedian'. People with 3 are naturally funny and usually a class clown in school or at work. It's also the number of expression. You have a way of expressing yourself in a way that makes people first listen and then listen again. A lot of the time, number 3s learn a subject, and when they finally understand it, they just think, 'Why didn't he explain it that way instead? It would have been way easier.' You have the gift of explaining and expressing any complicated topic in a simple way and also in a very entertaining way to make people listen without losing focus. Any field that involves communication is where you can thrive: teaching, sales, social media, radio, voice acting, coaching, and so forth. 3s, especially females, often lack sexual drive, but this can be balanced by your second energy. If that's the case, you should get that checked by a doctor. 3s don't need much to be happy; they find pleasure in the simple things in life. I personally think it's a beautiful thing, and I wish I could be like that! Also, number 3s can have a problem in life, especially with immaturity, if they didn't have both a father and a mother figure. If so, I would strongly suggest joining a club, whether it be a gym, martial arts, or a hobby, where you can meet people trying to better themselves. They also like to cheat, break rules, and see what they can get away with. Often, they have a bit of a criminal mindset. So, if that's an issue, you should look into it. Also, if you want to change something about yourself, you need to replace it with something else. Energy cannot be created nor destroyed; it can only be transferred. So, if you don't replace an old habit with something new, you will always revert back to it. That's a mistake a lot of 3s trying to better themselves make, so be mindful of that. Because 3s enjoy the simple things in life, eating is one of those, and a lot of 3s suffer from obesity. So, that's another thing to keep in mind. Try to replace food addiction with something else. Just some food for thought; we can go over 3 weeks without eating. 99% of people don't actually eat when they need to but when they want to, which is an addiction. Not because your stomach is growling means you should start eating. The stomach is actually the second brain, and giving it a break once in a while can do magical things, such as spiritual downloads. It will switch your body from an acidic state to an alkaline state, which in turn will reduce mucus, kill cancer cells and parasites, and also regenerate your cells. 3s have no soulmate number but the number 3, so try to surround yourself with people under the number 3. In most cases, 4s have a bad relationship with the number 4 because 4 is all about law and order, discipline, and hard work, which is the opposite of you. 3s see good matches with the number 1s and the number 2s. If you don't get along with people under 1 energy, that means that mentally something is wrong, and you should try to see into confidence issues. Also, 3s usually don't do well with the number 7 because the number 7 is actually the number that hates itself the most, and you are the complete opposite, so it creates friction.`,
      4: `So you're a Life Path 4. 4 is the number of the hardest worker; individuals with 4 energy can work like no one else, especially if it’s your Life Path number. Most people don’t really like working, but the 4 actually enjoy working, and if you don’t find joy in your work, then you're definitely in the wrong field, my friend. To be able to be the hardest worker, you gotta have a strong body. That’s why people under 4 energy usually have higher muscle mass; they are big-boned, more on the buffer side. 4 is also strongly linked to 22, which is a number very much present in the bodybuilding space. A lot of the greatest of all time in the bodybuilding world are born on the 22nd; even Bradley Martin, the biggest fitness/bodybuilding guy on the internet, is born on the 22nd. Not just bodybuilding, but if you look at the guy Bryan Johnson, who spends 3 million a year on his body, he’s trying to be the human to live the longest, and he’s also born on the 22nd, which is strongly linked to the number 4. 4 is the number of law and order; a lot of individuals are either in security, policemen, or in the military. They do very well in those environments, but whatever they do, they will overwork everybody else. If you look at a table, it has 4 legs; if you take one out, it falls right away. 4 are actually the ones holding society up; they bring stability to society. Also, 4 don’t like to take days off; even if they're sick, they will still go to work. Your partial energy can change things a bit, but usually, they will never take days off. One thing about the 4 is that they are the least creative number but the most logical out of all the numbers. They are left hemisphere dominant. If I tell you it’s raining outside, you're most likely gonna look and check for yourself. The partial energy can also have an effect on your creativity level; that’s one thing to keep in mind. Because you’re so logical, you can often be very robotic; so that’s one thing to keep in mind. 4 like to give out orders and take things in command; they are strongly linked to the number 8 in this aspect. You both have an air of authority and don’t like people arguing with you in a "how do you question my authority" type of way. 4 people also have a very strong sex drive, just like the number 5; even when it gets to older ages, 4 still like to get things wild in the bedroom. 4 is the number of the builder, just like the 22 is the master builder. Y’all constantly need to see progress in whatever you are doing or else you can fall into burnout and depression. Hard work will never burn you out, but a lack of progress certainly will. The 4 usually get harassed by people in your circle with things like "you always work, you need to take a break," but they just don’t understand what you are, so if you're getting into a new relationship, that’s definitely something that needs to be addressed early on. 4 is also the number of discipline and consistency, but sometimes it’s also important to let it loose a little. 4 a lot of the time end up falling for someone in the workplace; just one of the things 4 do. Also, the 4 follows the textbook; whatever the textbook said, that’s how they usually do it. They follow the law; they are not the type to break it, such as a number 3; they like to stay in the box. If you look at a box or has 4 sides. Also, 4 is a big money number, right after 28 and 8. As an example, you can look at Bernard Arnault, born March 5, 1949, which is a Life Path 4. He’s now in competition to be the richest guy on the planet. A lot of other companies such as Amazon, J.P. Morgan have that 4 energy by either the incorporation or the owner. Both Microsoft and Facebook are companies with the 4 incorporated. Donald Trump is also a 4, and he’s always preaching about law and order, especially under 4-day energy. The soulmate of the number 4 is the number 8. Y’all are strongly linked together with very similar qualities and make a great team; if you have an 8 working with a 4, it’s a recipe for success. You also have a 33% chance of not getting along with someone who has 3 energy; y’all are very different in every aspect together, and it’s just not a good match. You also have a one-sided energy with the number 7, where you subconsciously suck the energy out of the 7; nothing wrong; it’s just what naturally happens. Another thing is that 4s are usually obsessed with the number 5, and the 5 sucks the energy out of the 4, energy-wise and monetarily, so that’s one thing to watch out for; if that’s the case, put boundaries in place; you won’t have issues doing that as a 4. Overall, 4 is a very important number in society; without the 4, everything will crumble. If the number 4 takes a day off, the world would have a massive catastrophe. The purpose of the 4 is to work; you don’t have a specific field that you should work in; like I said earlier, the military, policemen is a good job for the 4, but in anything you work, as long as you love to work, you should be alright. If you wanna prosper in life, you should try to surround yourself with 8 and 22; if you start any project with those numbers, it’s game over from the jump. I would also recommend you wake up in the morning under 4 or 22 energy; if you wake up at 6:30, put the time for 6:22.`,
      5: `So you're a Life Path 5. The 5 is the number of freedom. They love freedom like no other number. They are not really the type to be fine with a 9-5, and they often fight to think outside the box. They don’t like it when you tell them what to do. Out of all the numbers, the 5s are the ones who travel the most. They just love to move around and always be in constant motion. Often, life circumstances don’t let them do so, but if they could, they would. Some numbers, such as the 4s and the 8s, don’t like to be away for too long and always in motion, but the number 5 sure does. They can get into depression and burnout if once in a while they don’t go on an adventure. It's also the number of changes. They don’t like to keep things the same for too long; they like to change a lot. That’s also because they have a hard time making decisions. The 8 also has a hard time making decisions, but even when the 5 makes a decision, they always think back about if it was the best decision or not, and then they change to the next thing. Focus, commitment, and discipline are usually the enemies of the 5, so that's one thing to keep in mind and work on because in the long term, it can cause you to not build something solid and always be back at ground zero, restarting with the next new thing. 5 is also the number of good looks, especially for females but also for males. Not necessarily 'good looks,' but facial symmetry. 5 is also the number of the entertainer. As you can see, entertainment starts with 'e,' which is the 5th letter. They love entertainment as they are depth-based. They not only live entertainment but they are also very entertaining. If you want to have a good time, bring a 5 around. Let’s say they are a teacher of a boring subject; they will somehow find a way to turn it into fun. The number 5 is also the number of sex. If you look at the first vowel: 'Sex,' 'Reproduction,' 'Seed' all start with 'e.' They are also very hospitable people. The 7 people are not very hospitable as they like to be alone, but with the 5, it’s the opposite. They love to show hospitality and have people over. 5s, just like 9s, are great risk-takers as it brings excitement and new adventure. A lot of 5s do well in business and especially in crypto. They love to live the nomadic, make-money-in-e-commerce life! You can’t force a 5 to do anything; they will do what they want to do, and when they don’t like it, they just fly away like a bird. They are more the type to turn to flexibility instead of stability; they will always be that way, and it’s just how they are. Number 5 is actually the smartest number after 33 and 7. It gives a lot of competition with 9, but overall, the 5s are smarter because they get into fewer problems with substances and so forth. The 5's soulmate is the number 5. They go great together, and because 11 has that master number elevated frequency, it raises the energy of the 5, so that’s one thing to keep in mind. The 5's friendly numbers are the 7s and the 33s. Keep in mind that the 7s don’t do well with most people, but they can hang around a 5 with no problem. They don’t like much attention, but 5s are always on the go, so on the long run, it creates a nice dynamic for the two. The 5 also has a love/hate relationship with the 6, but in the long term, they can be great partners and great lovers if they understand each other's nature and not try to change it. And the enemy number of the 5 is the number 8. 8 loves to give commands and orders, and it just doesn’t fly with the number 5, especially if you work at a job and your boss is a number 8. It won’t last long, and while it lasts, it will bring misery into your life.`,
      6: `So you're a Life Path 6. 6 is the number of home and family; they love to settle down and have a family, unlike the 7 which is anti-family with a loner vibe. The 6 loves the regular life with 2-3 children and a white picket fence. The number 6 is also the number of responsibility. The number 3, which is the most childish and also the most immature, is the complete opposite. 6s don’t really get in trouble; they follow the rules and stay responsible. They are often your average Joe kind of person, which is not an insult. They find peace in that life. 6 is also the number of time. If you look closely at time, 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, which all reduce down to the number 6. If you add all the 6 together, it adds up to 666. The elite love to refer to 666 as the number of Satan, but it's not. They want to destroy the nuclear family, and that is why they chose the number 6 to put a bad connotation on it because energetically wise, it attacks the 6 and what the 6 represents. A lot of 6s are lower on the IQ scale, but around 25% of them are extremely smart. There really is no middle ground, and if you're entertaining energy and understanding hard esoteric concepts such as numerology, I would be ready to put my money on the fact that you are part of the 25% without a doubt. Also, another thing is that a lot of 6s suffer from obesity. If you look closely at the number 6, it kinda looks like a pregnant woman, and everything has duality, so they usually have a higher fat percentage than other numbers. So that's really one thing you must analyze with no emotion involved and take action if that's the case, but understand that it’s in your nature. Usually, men with 6 energy are good in the bedroom, just a natural at it. In my opinion, it's better; they are prone to be in long-term relations since a young age where they have access to it all the time, and they get more practice than other numbers. 6s also love children, not in any creepy ways, just that 6 is the number of home and family, and what is a family without children, right? 6s have a special soulmate kind of relationship with the number 5, where it saves the 5 from risk by bringing stability and responsibility, and as a result, the 5 brings excitement into the life of the 6. They plug into each other's weaknesses, and it forms a very compatible relationship. Also, the soulmate for the number 6, even more than the 5, is the number 33. If you reduce down the 33, you get a 6. The power of the 33 is actually connected to the 33, and 33 is also attached to the 3. A Life Path 3 is also compatible with the 6, but usually, the 3s tend to leave and, in most cases, end up regretting it later. The enemy number of the 6 is the 7. I am talking about the 25% of the smartest 6s at the moment as 6 is the family and 7 is the anti-family, and when you get a smart 6, the 7, which is a very smart number, starts to compete with the 6, and it creates a lot of friction, so that's one thing to know. If you want a good example of this, all you gotta look at is the competition between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Jeff is a 6, and Elon is a 7. They are always competing and trying to take each other out. Overall, for a 6 to be happy, you need a stable income with a lover on your side and a couple of kids on their way. If you have that, you can live a very purpose-driven life as someone with 6 energy!`,
      7: `So you're a Life Path 7. One thing I must say now is that you have an incredible gift, but the gift also comes with multiple curses, so please read this without emotion and don’t hate the messenger. The 7 is a lone wolf; it’s the lover vibe, the complete opposite from the 6, which is all about home and family. The 7 likes to be alone; they are not the most hospitable and they don’t like company for long periods of time, especially for males. If you're a female, it can change a bit, but overall, you're still likely to be the introverted type. Out of all the numbers, the number 7 is the highest in intelligence, right next to the 33. Some of the smartest people to ever exist were born with this 7 energy, just like Steven Hawking, Leonard Euler, and so forth. The 7s are extremely book smart but not the smartest street smart. Of course, I’m not saying you're not street smart because the environment and the way you grew up can make a difference in the verdict. 7s, because they like to be alone so much, are actually not the greatest at relationships. Never forget that I’m here to tell you the cold hard truth because love ain’t lies. As a 7, you have immense potential, but also you need to look at reality for what it really is. First off, you're the most hated number, and you also most likely hate them back. You always live in your head; you overthink too much. Also, the number 7 is the number that hates himself the most, probably because you live in your head too much and overthink things and you're too critical of yourself. You gotta understand that it’s simply in your nature. If you wanna get through the self-hate, I got something I make 7s do. 3s is the number that 7s hate the most because 3 is the opposite; they love themselves the most. So what I suggest you do is find yourself someone with 3 energy and force yourself to hang with them. It might be uncomfortable at the start, but eventually you will get over it, and as a result, your relationship with all numbers will be significantly better. Also, all the things that I mentioned are relative to your partial number. You gotta look at yourself with no emotion and truly analyze what you are lacking. Another thing is that although the 7s are the smartest, y’all communication skills are very weak, especially if you're a man. So if you decide to do the relationship with the 3, they are the best at communication with the 11, so over time, your subconscious will pick up their tips and tricks, and you will get way better. After that, you're gonna have the gift to communicate what goes on in your mind, your ideas, and how to express them on a deep level. 7s are injury-prone. What I recommend is for all 7s to follow a strict workout routine. If you're really not a fan of working out, you need to take a nice big walk at least 3 times a week. Go outside, get some sunlight, smell the day, and tell yourself that you're grateful for this wonderful day. 7 is kinda like autism; you get a super great gift but it comes with the downside as well. Now, onto the positive. Nobody can match you intellectually except for the 33. You can analyze everything on a very deep level like no other. You're the type to come up with the answer, but you can’t explain how you got there. Your brain works in a very complicated way which I don’t think I will ever fully understand. You are both left hemisphere brain and right hemisphere dominant at the same time; your brain often does what’s called a hemi-sync. If you wanna learn more about that, go look at the declassified CIA document called the Gateway Process. Also, the 7 is the most misunderstood number out of all; just like the geniuses that people finally realized were right but way past their lifetime, it just is what it is. The difference between the 33 and the 7 is that 33s are so much more influential because they know how to express their ideas and concepts to the masses in a way for them to understand, but you can certainly work on that, and if there’s a will, there’s a way. The entire argument about emotional intelligence vs IQ applies to the 7; they are not the most advanced with emotion, especially for men. The women can get by, but the men have a harder time. Your enemy numbers are all the numbers, not that they overtly hate you, but that you know you got loner energy. The number 6 is your worst enemy, not all of them, only about 20%; most 6s are not that high on intelligence, but 20% of them are very smart, and those ones are gonna be your sworn enemies. Just like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, a 6 and 7 coming at each other's throat. There is one number that you fit well with, and it’s the number 9. Usually, y’all have a lifelong friendship with each other. A 7 doesn’t need nor want a lot of friends. All you need is about 3 good friends to have a very happy and social life. Also, the 7 often finds himself attracted to the 11 person, but the 11 doesn’t reciprocate because they are the most emotional number and they need that connection but the 7s are lacking in that aspect, so just know in advance if the person is an 11. For the 7 to find purpose, I would say it is the easiest out of all the numbers; you're naturally an intellectual, so all you gotta look into is what you're interested in. See if you can earn a living by doing so and voilà… any jobs where you're mentally stimulated will be good for you. You have an immense powerhouse of a brain that if it is not used will burn you from the inside so to be mentally stimulated is a plus. In any relationship, if the other person is not an intellectual, it will not work. Also, because the 7s are alone most of the time, they often end up addicted to porn. Not saying you are, but if you are, that should be something to work on. I hope everything makes sense, but you're a 7 so I don’t doubt you. Overall, you're smarter than most people; they can’t really understand what you're talking about, they can’t see what is gonna happen like you can, you're too advanced for your own good. But that’s okay. Find someone that will resonate with you and I'm that’s all that’s important. You're already on the right path being here because you're actually learning about yourself and I trust you will make a killing out here. Another note is that all of the downsides that come with it can and probably are balanced by your partial energy so don’t take everything at face value because yes, every human is different and you know yourself better. So if the hat fits, wear it; if it doesn’t, then don’t :`,
      8: `So you're a Lifepath 8. A lot of 8s are actually confused because they think that 8 is the number of money, but 8 is not the number of money… 8 is the number of abundance… Money is a man-made concept, but abundance isn’t. In the time when we used to trade goods like spices, cows, etc., to sustain ourselves, the 8 would have generally been the one with the most of whatever was valuable at the time. The thing with 8s is that y’all don’t have the same scarcity mindset that most people have. Most people have a scarcity mindset and they hate money, as a result, it changes their thought which, in turn, changes their actions and ends up changing the result of it all. To come back to the original point. Would you be wrong to say 8 is the number of money? It became the number of money, so not totally but at its core it’s not. People with 8 on top of that love power; they love to be the boss and tell people what to do. You wanna see a happy 8? Just look at an 8 commanding things and giving orders; you're gonna see a happy 8, especially with the male 8. As an 8, you should be getting a lot of money and have some authority. 8s love authority. And they don’t like to argue as in (why are you questioning my authority); that’s why a lot of 8s have a love/hate relationship with the number 1 because they can respect the masculine boldness of the 1 but don’t like to argue with them as 1s are very confrontational… 8 is also the number of Karma, if you look at the number 8 it creates an infinity sign which has two aspects to it, first is the karma, what goes around comes around, if anybody tries to mess with an 8 karma will hit harder than any other number, y’all are extremely karmic… But it goes in both senses, as an 8 you can't be doing bad things, and for 2 reasons. First is that karma will really hit you hard, fast and if not fast in the worst of moments. Secondly (not proven) but there is actually a theory which id not proven but I, as a numerologist who deeply analyzes the cycle of number, think it makes sense, is that if you believe in reincarnation that you gotta go thru the number 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and learn all the leçon to then get to the number 8 and be quote on quote in a position of power to then mess around with that power and use it for bad and as a result you get hit back to the beginning of the cycle and then restart they the lifetime, and that’s karma way of really teaching you the leçon, that’s if you believe in reincarnation of course. which is information I give you and I think it’s true but can’t be proven just to clarify. To come back to the shape of the 8 in the different aspect like I was explaining earlier. 8 isn’t just what goes around comes around, it’s also as 2 zero with a separation which basically means that your gonna live an erratic/chaotic life, everything will always up and down, up and down are just the normals for 8s… but on the overall trajectory, it will be more on the up side as everything stabilize with time but 8s live the most chaotic life. People with the number 8 also are also very spiritual, just the fact that you're reading this right now proves the point, y’all have have as above so below energy, the ying Yang…. Another thing to keep in mind is that 8s have a hard time making decision, they are very undecisive but when they finally make a decision, they stick with that decision and go full mode into it. 8 is always a very artistic number which we don’t hear often but yes, very artistic and you can see so by looking at people with 8 energy such as Michelangelo, Picasso, etc… The next thing that Lifepath 8s must be extremely careful with is being a dictator, either they are great leaders or total dictator and that's on you to make the choice but I think you already know what to choose, karma is looking at you sideways right now ahah… People with 8 energy do extremely well with 4s, they have a similar mentality and they both like to command and order, very compatible energy. The 6 is already a friendly number, and we talked about the love/hate relationship with the 1 earlier. Your enemy number is the number 5, they don’t like authority type person and they are more freedom based, really is that they don't like you, although if you don't act in your main nature they can hang around with no problem but if let's say you're a boss and you wanna hire someone, a 5 would be the worst option. Also, a secret is to watch the new people coming into your life, if they are 8s, it either means that some money will come or go or you will get some type of karma so that's one thing to look out for. 8s in life really can do anything related to making a lot of money because it's not the definition of abundance, you don't have a particular field where you will do better as long as you're in a position of power. But a lot of 8s go overboard into obtaining money and power that they neglect other aspects of life, 8s should not only focus on money but on 4 aspects, the first one is health, the second one is wealth, the third one is love, and the final one is happiness, if they can bring the other 3 aspects into their life and not just wealth they will live a very happy life.`,
      9: `So you're a Life Path 9. 9 is one of the most misunderstood numbers out here; it’s an extremely important number in the matrix. 9 is the number of completion and ending, but not only that, when something comes to a 9, either it ends right there, or it gets transcended to the next level into a better version. 9 is the number of reality and illusion. Reality starts with "R," which is the 18th letter, and illusion starts with "I," which is the 9th letter. Because reality is not really the realm we live in. Everything is an illusion; nothing is really there. That table you see is not actually hard; the energy is just moving extremely slow to a point where you think it’s solid, but solid matter is not actually real. When I said number 9 is the number manifestation, not necessarily that 9s are the richest because they are not, although they could be. 9 thrives in society when it’s based on spirituality. If it’s not based on spirituality, they have a hard time finding their purpose. Every single thing around you is a 9. Don’t believe me? If it’s physical, it has a shape by definition. Just look at all the shapes. Let’s say a circle, it has 360 degrees. 3+6=9. Or a square; 1 angle has 90 degrees, 2 angles is 180, which is 9, 3 has 270, which is 9, all four angles have 360 degrees, which is 9. You're starting to understand? On another note, 9s are extremely spiritual and usually rebellious; they don’t fit well in the box; they like to live outside the box. They are also one of the smartest numbers, but a lot of them are complete failures. 9 used to be widely respected in multiple ancient civilizations; in other numerology systems, they don’t even include the 9 because they have too much respect for it. But the more this new world evolves with all technologies and especially the elite controlling us and blocking our spiritual ability, 9s have become kind of obsolete. That’s why a lot of them are addicted to drugs. If you want a good example, just look at the "Wolf of Wall Street"; everyone likes this movie, right? Well, it was based on Jordan Belfort, who is born on the 9th; he was doing drug cocktails and mixing them for different periods of the day. So taking substances is one thing that all 9s should be very careful with because they have an addicted personality as it’s hard for them to live in this era. But there are some evolved 9s. You're reading this, so you're probably an evolved 9 yourself; I'm an evolved 9. 9 also has the biggest ego. If you look at gematria, ego equals 9, and an ego is a superpower as long as you work hard to enjoy it. A reason 9s fall into drugs is because they think they are the best but don’t actually do the job to justify it. So they can’t cope with it and get addicted to substances. When talking about the ego, it’s normal that 9s have the biggest ego. 9 is all around you; everything always comes back to the 9; 9x2 is 18, 1+8 is 9, and you can do so with any numbers. That’s also why they are very adaptable; they can adapt to every situation. That is one of your gifts; you're extremely smart. The illusion and reality are dictated by the 9; without 9, reality is not full; it dictates what ends and what revolves to the next level. 9s are one of the smartest; one of the most spiritually advanced. Now I’m gonna drop some big secrets right now, and don’t forget where you heard it from. Numerology 33… 9 is connected to the eye. 👁️ The letter "I" is the 9th letter; pronounce "eye" and "I," same thing right? The frequency you use when saying it is the exact same, even in Arabic, the 18th letter when you say it is the same. A lot of 9s with karmic debt have eye problems; the elite gotta tell you everything; they told us in the movie "Jack Sparrow" with Johnny Depp. He's born in the 9th; he wore a patch on his eye, and in real life, he’s actually close to being blind in one eye and has another problem in his other eye. What I think is one of the reasons 9s are so spiritually advanced is that because the 9 is connected with the eye and often have eye problems, the other senses get stronger. 9 is also strongly linked to the number 2, which is the feminine, extremely intuitive. Just look at the word "femi(nine)"; you can’t say it without the 9 in there. 9s are also energy suckers; they suck energy out of the numbers like a black hole. If you draw a 9 starting from the bottom and continue the motion, you will actually make a continuous spiral. Look at the pie; the pattern of the pie, which first vowel is 1, the 9th letter. Now, I’m saying too much, ahah... On another note, I got another secret for you and the 9. There was a city called Nineveh built by non-elites who were close to overpowering the elite, but they lost and were destroyed; you should really look into that. One thing for sure is that if there is ever utopia on earth, 9 will be one of the major reasons behind it. 9 is also the most useful energy if you want to open your third eye. When I said that 9s are energy suckers, that is why usually 9s are the enemies of the master numbers because they have a lot of energy and it gets sucked right in. So to end about the 9, the friendly numbers of the number 9 are the 1-9, and the enemies are the 11-22 and the 33.`
