                9 is one of the most misunderstood numbers out here; it's an extremely important number in the matrix. 9 is the number of completion and ending, but not only that, when something comes to a 9, either it ends right there, or it gets transcended to the next level into a better version.

                  9 is the number of reality and illusion. Reality starts with "R," which is the 18th letter, and illusion starts with "I," which is the 9th letter. Because reality is not really the realm we live in.

                  In this modern world of technology, 9s face unique challenges. The elite controlling and blocking spiritual abilities has made 9s somewhat obsolete. However, evolved 9s (like you, reading this) exist and thrive.

                    9s should be very careful with substances due to their addictive personality. It's harder for them to live in this era, but with awareness comes strength.

                  9 is connected to the eye. The letter "I" is the 9th letter; pronounce "eye" and "I" - same frequency, same meaning. This connection runs deep, even in Arabic.
