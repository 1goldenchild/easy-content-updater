                9 is the number of reality and illusion. Reality starts with "R," which is the 18th letter, 
                and illusion starts with "I," which is the 9th letter. Because reality is not really the realm we live in.

                  9 is connected to the eye. üëÅÔ∏è The letter "I" is the 9th letter; pronounce "eye" and "I," 
                  same thing right? The frequency you use when saying it is the exact same, even in Arabic, 
                  the 18th letter when you say it is the same.

                  9s are also energy suckers; they suck energy out of the numbers like a black hole.

                  a continuous spiral.
